### Sub title for the about page

Alten Decks is designed to be a community-based knowledge sharing platform. Its content is driven by collaborators and consists of decks and cards. Decks are logical clusters of subject-related topics, which are represented by cards in this context. Each card provides crucial information on a topic and includes links to external resources for further reading. Users can read and bookmark cards, allowing them to return to them easily. In future iterations, the platform aims to facilitate conversations around card topics to share ideas and experiences.
