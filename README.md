# Alten Decks

Alten Decks is a community-based knowledge sharing platform. Its content is driven by collaborators.

The platform consists of `decks` and `cards`. Decks are logical clusters of subject-related topics, represented by cards. A card contains crucial information about the topic and provides links to external resources for further reading. Users can read and bookmark cards, allowing them to return to them later. In future iterations, the platform aims to include discussions around card topics for sharing ideas and experiences.
